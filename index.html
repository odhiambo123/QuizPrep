      <h2>Intro to Java concepts</h2>

      <p>What JVM?</p>
      <p>Java Virtual Machine</p>

      <p>What is JRE</p>
      <p>Java runtime environment, a set of components to create and run a Java application. It is a part of JDK and is made up of JVM, Class libraries and Java class loader. it provides the the programming tools and deployment technologies. JRE runs on top of the OS to provide additional Java resources</p>

      <p>What is JDK</p>
      <p>Java Development Kit, It implements the Java Language specification, JLS, and Java Virtual Machine specification, JVMS, and provide the standard edition SE of the Java Application Programming Interface.</p>

      <p>What are Methords and Parameters</p>
      <p>A metod is a block of code which only runs when its called. You can pass data with the method, this data is called parameters. methods are also know as functions</p>

      <p>what is method overloading</p>
      <p>Ability to create multiple functions or methods with the same name but different implementations</p>

      <p>what is method overriding</p>
      <p>this is a language feaature that allows a subclass or a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent class. it allows for a specific kind of polymorphism. the implementation in the subclass overrides the implementation in the superclass. </p>

      <p>What is an Exception</p>
      <p>
        An event which occurs during and execution of a program, That disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. This is called Throwwing an Exception. 
      </p>

      <p>what is control flow</p>
      <p>The order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an iperative program are Executed or evaluated.</p>

      <p>what are primitive types</p>
      <p>The basic set of data types from which all other data types are constructed int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char. they are further divided into three: floating point, intergral, and character and string literals</p>

      <p>What is Git</p>
      <p>Sofware for tracking changes in any set of files </p>

      <p>What are Objects in Java</p>
      <p>They instances of a class that model real world objects; having related behaviors and states. states are stored in fields while behaviors are exposed through mehods</p>

      <p>Encapsulation</p>
      <p>Hiding all the internals; requiring interaction through methods. Encapsulation ensures that an object remains in control of how its data is used</p>

      <p>Benefits of Objects</p>
      <p> Modularity, Information hiding, code reuse, plugability and easy fixing</p>

      <p>What is a Class</p>
      <p>A class is the blueprint from which objects are made.</p>

      <p>Inheritence</p>
      <p>derivind a class, subclass from a parent class, superclass. in inheritence a class can only have one superclass.</p>

      <p>What is a Package</p>
      <p>A package is a namespace that organizes related classes. 
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html
      </p>

      <p>Variables</p>
      <p> Are containers for storing data values. Instance variables/non-static-variables, Class variables/static fields, Local variables.</p>

      <p>Arrays</p>
      <p>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.<br> 
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html

        <br>
      </p>

      <p>Access Modifiers</p>
      <p>Public declarations are visible everywhere, Default are visible within a package, Protected are visible within
        it's packacge and subclasses of its class in another package, Private are visible within the class.<br><a

      <p>What happens after a method throws an exception</p>
      <p>The runtime attempts to find something to handle it from the methods list that had been called to get to the
        method where the error occured. the listforms the call stack <br><a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/definition.html">Exception</a> </p>

      <p>what is an exception handler?</p>
      <p>The block of code in the call stack that can handle a the exception in question</p>

      <p>What is mean by Catching an Exception</p>
      <p>The Exception handler chosen to appropriately handle the exception is said to have cought the exception.</p>

      <p>Name Three types of exceptions</p>
      <p>Checked Exceptions - A well written Java code should be able to recover from these exceptions<br>Error - these are normally external to the application and the application cannot anticipate recovering from them, eg system malfunction. Errors are not subject to Catch or specify requirement<br> runtime exceptions are internal to the application and the application cannot anticipate to recover from them. They may include logic errors or improper use of an API. <br> Errors and runtime exceptions are called unchecked exceptions</p>

      <p>What are the exception handler components</p>
      <p>Try, Catch and Finally Blocks</p>

      <p>Autoclosable</p>
      <p>Object that may hold resources(such as file or socket handles) until it's closed. <br>The close() method of an
        Autoclosable object is called automatically when exiting a try-with-resources block for which it the object has
        been declared in the resource specification header <br><a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/chained.html">Exceptions</a></p>

      <p>Construstors</p>
      <p>Is a method invoked when the keyword new is used to create an object. </p>

      <p>this Keyword</p>
      <p>Used is used to refer to the current object. the object whose costructor or method is being called</p>

      <h2>Collections</h2>

      <p>Collections</p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/"> docs</a><br>
        A collection is an object tha groups multiple elements together<br>
        Collections framework is the unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections<br>
        Collections framework contain:<br>
        interfaces: abstract data types that represent collections<br>
        Implementations: concrete implementations of the collections interfaces<br> Algorithms:
        methods that peform useful computations.<br>
      </p>

      <p>Different Types of collections</p>
      <p>Collection(Set(sortedSet), List, Queue, Deque), Map(SortedMap))</p>

      <div>
        <p>Generics</p>
        <div><img src="img/puffy.png" alt="Puffy" /></div>
      </div>
      <p>Generics Enables types (clases and interfaces) to be parameters when defining clases, interfaces and methods. It enable stronger type checks during compile time, Eliminates casting, Enables implementation of generic algorithms typesafe algorithms.</p>

        <div><img src="img/tux-with-pipe.jpg" alt="Tux smoking aÂ pipe" /></div>
      </div>
      <p>Compiler create objects or primitives wherever necessary during compile time. for example: converting and int
        to its wrapper object, integer<br>The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:<br>

        Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.<br>
        Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class</p>
      <h2>Kotlin And Android</h2>
        <p>Key Kotlin Benefits</p>
        <p>
          Pragmatic: used to solve real world problems <br>
          It supports multiple programming paradigms <br>
          1. Imperative programming<br>
          2. Generic Programming <br>
          3. Functional programming<br> and more...<br>
          Kotlin is tool friendly being compatible with all major development tools.
        </p>


        <p>Difference between var and val in Kotlin</p>
        <p> Variables declared with var are final , with with var are not</p>
      <p>Conditionals</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/ac7565819bd31ff2a9ddb55764058d16">Conditionals Demo</a>
      </p>

      <p>Arrays </p>
      <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values instead of having separate variable to each one <br> val cars = arrayOf("volvo","bmw","toyota")<br>
      Kotlin also provides primitive type arrays ByteArray, ShortArray, IntArray, and so on</p>

      <p>Variable </p>
      <p>Immutable -cannot change val<br>Mutable can change var</p>

      <p>Operators in Kotlin</p>
      <p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html#operators-and-special-symbols">docs</a></p>

      <p>function()</p>
      <p>A block of code which only runs when its called and are used to perform certain actions</p>

      <p>How is Nullability Handled in Kotlin?</p>
      <p>The type system distinguishes between refference that can hold null and those that can't. to allow nulls use '?', String?. to use a nullable refference, you can check if it's null by using an if statement or an Elvis operator. <br>To throw an NPE, use a not-null operator (!!). to return a non null value or NPE<br></p>


        <p>Class</p>
    <p>A class can be defined as aUser defined Data structure. <br>
        The class declaration consists of the class name, the class header (specifying its type parameters, the primary
        constructor etc.) and the class body, surrounded by curly braces. Both the header and the body are optional; if
        the class has no body, curly braces can be omitted.</p>

      <p>what is an Object?</p>
      <p>An Object is an instance of a class</p>

      <p>what file extensions are used in kotlin files?</p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>What is the default access level of Kotlin classes</p>
      <p>
        Visibility is Public by default
        All classes are also final in Kotlin classes are by default

      </p>

        apply<br>
        also
      </p>

      <p>What is Backporting</p>
      <p>It means taking parts from a newer version of software system or components and adapting them to an older
        version of the same software.
      </p>

      <p>what are Widgets</p>
      <p>
        They are graphic and control elements that helpsusers interract with our applications.<br>Widgets can be
        buttons, input fields, drop-down menues, images, and more
      </p>

      <p>what type of file do I use to describe widgets</p>
      <p>
        Layout files, normaly stored in the res/layout
      </p>

      <p>what is an adapter</p>
      <p>
        An adapter loads information to be displayed from datasource such as an array or database querry and creates a
        view for each item.

        <br>
        ListView is a subclass of AdapterView so it can be populated by binding it to adapter
      </p>

      <p>What is a companion object in Kotlin?</p>
      <p>
        This is the equvalent of a static keyword in Java. A companion object becomes common to all the instances of the
        class. it canno be declared outside of the class.
      </p>

      <p>What does a LayoutInflator do?</p>
      <p>
        It is used to create a new View(or Layout) object from an XML layout.
      </p>

      <p>What does findViewById do</p>
      <p>
        It gives you a refference to a view that has already been created
      </p>

      <p>what does a setContentView in onCreate do</p>
      <p>
        Whenever its called, the activity's layout along a with its subviews gets inflated behind the cenes.
        </p>

      <p>when do you use findViewById and LayoutInflator</p>
      <p>
        If the view already exists, use findViewById, but if not, creat it using LayoutInflater.
      </p>

      <p>Observable</p>
      <p>
        Returns a property delegate for a read/write property that calls a specified callback function when changed
      </p>

<p>what is foreign key refferential constraint</p>
<p>A referential constraint is the rule that the values of the foreign key are valid only if one of the following
  conditions is true:
  They appear as values of a parent key.
  Some component of the foreign key is null.</p>

      <p>What is an ER Diagram</p>
      <p>An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how âentitiesâ such as people,

      <h2>Data Structures</h2>
      <p>What is an m-ary tree</p>
      <p>In graph theory, an m-ary tree (also known as k-ary or k-way tree) is a rooted tree in which each node has no
        more than m children.<br> A binary tree is the special case where m = 2, <br>A ternary tree is another case with
        m =
        3 that limits its children to three</p>

      <p>What is a B+ tree</p>
      <p>A B+ tree is an m-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node. <br>A B+ tree consists
        of a
        root, internal nodes and leaves.<br> The root may be either a leaf or a node with two or more children.</p>

      <h2>App Architecture</h2>
      <p>What is App architecture</p>
      <p>App architecture defines the boundaries between parts of the app and the responsibilities each part should have
      </p>
      <P>Separation of concerns</P>
      <p>Helps to keep code clean and to stay away from problems related to life cycle<br>
        Keep the UI layer separate from Logic and data layer</p>

      <p>Driving UI from Data Models</p>
      <p>Data models represent the app data and are independent of the UI</p>

        <p>UI Layer</p>
        <p>representation layer for user interaction<br>
          â¢ UI elements that render the data on the screen. You build these elements
          using Views or Jetpack Compose functions.<br>
          â¢ State holders (such as ViewModel classes) that hold data, expose it to the UI,
          and handle logic. </p>
        <p>Data Layer</p>
        <p> The data layer is made of repositories that each can contain zero to
          many data sources. <br>You should create a repository class for each
          different type of data you handle in your app. <br>For example, you might
          create a MoviesRepository class for data related to movies.<br> PaymentsRepository class for data related to
          payments</p>

          <p>Dependencies</p>
          <p>Classes in the app depend on other classes for proper functioning</p>

          <p>Dependency Injection(DI)</p>
          <P>Taking the dependencies of a class ans providing them rather thatn having the class instance obtain them
            itself.<br><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection">Docs</a> </P>

            <p>Service Locator</p>
            <p> in this method, registry is provided where classes can obtain their dependencies rather than
              constructing them.</p>

              <p>How do you reduce dependencies on classes</p>
              <p>By making sure your app components are the only clasesrelying on Android framework SDK APIs such as
                Context or Toast<br>
                Abstracting other classes in your app away from them helps with testability and reduces coupling within
                app</p>

                <p>What is MVVM</p>
